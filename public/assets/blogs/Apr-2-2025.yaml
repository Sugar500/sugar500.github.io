      <strong>Website Project:</strong> When using document.addEventListener it is better to have an onload or DOMLoad 
      event that is where you instigate the event listener. Otherwise they may not register sometimes.

      I learned that using jest you just need to open coverage/Icov-report/index.html to be able to see your coverage 
      report, though it only lists files that have a .test.js. Maybe imported files too, haven't tested that. Learned 
      that from a quick skim on <a 
      href=\"https://aakanksha-02.medium.com/understanding-the-jest-coverage-report-a-complete-guide-57d950130fdc\">a 
      blog post about understanding jest coverage</a>. Had a lovely time trying to test window.onload and even more of 
      one with trying to test initMenu, part of that was debugging with Gemini.

      I learned that using jsdom you can enforce a loaded script using a read file sync and directly injecting it into 
      the document. I also learned how to test events and event listeners. You have to be very explicit that you are 
      using a previous part of your conversation with Gemini or you may have information restated.
