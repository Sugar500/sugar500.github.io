    Content:
      Created at DigiPen Institute of Technology on a team that switched from five to seven. The project was a two 
      semester project from fall of 2021 to spring of 2022 using the Unity 3D engine (C#). I designed and implemented 
      Procedural Content Generation for levels. I helped with both level and puzzle design, and implemented the basic 
      logic behind the potions and the potion crafting system.
