Short Summary: Notes about user stories in game development.
Long Summary:
  I was thinking about a way to plan out my new project and remembered about User Stories. So, I decided to research 
  them in more detail then the skim I had done previously.

      <p><strong>def.</strong> A <em>User Story</em> is a short, simple description of a feature as told from the point 
      of view of (typically) the user.</p>
      <p class=\"txt-center\">It usually follows [As a &lt type of user &gt, I want &lt some goal &gt so that &lt some 
      reason &gt] template.</p>
      <p><strong>note.</strong> Keeping them informal can help facilitate planning and discussion, but also allows them 
      to easily be thrown out as more is learned about the project and new stories take their place.</p>

      <p>1. Card - a written description of the story</p>
      <p>2. Conversation - a way to flush out details of the story. Or why the story is unneeded.</p>
      <p>3. Confirmation - tests that can be used to determine when the story is complete. A way to also document the 
      progress of the story.</p>

      Splitting a user story into smaller stories is one way to add details. Another way is to add conditions of 
      satisfaction or acceptance criteria to the story

      User Stories are more of a pointer to other forms of documentation such as - a workflow diagram, a spreadsheet 
      with instructions on calculations, other other artifacts.

      User Stories can be apart of agile development. Along side - Test-driven development (TDD), Continuous Integration 
      (CI), and more.

      <p>A user story in a game can be an overall game goal. In complex games like Skyrim it seems more like a narrative 
      goal.</p>
      <p class=\"txt-center\">As the dovakiin, I want to grow stronger so that I can defeat Alduin.</p>
      <p>Or the main mechanic, like in Mario...</p>
      <p class=\"txt-center\">As Mario, I want to jump, so that I can avoid or destroy obstacles.</p>
