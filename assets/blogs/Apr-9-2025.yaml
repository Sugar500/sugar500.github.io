      <p><strong>Website Project</strong> - Posted dev-unit-tests. Many (minor) bugs had gotten fixed.</p>
      <p><strong>Text-based Adventure (new!)</strong> - typescript, css and html. I chose Typescript because I wasnâ€™t 
      going to write a game without type checking. Web-dev because I wanted to be able to say I can make a game on the 
      web. I am using Excalibur.js because I plan on having an updating map with your current location, also it's just 
      fun to learn new dev tools. Made a config for commands, that was new, a test file for a class that parses a string 
      into a command with options, also added the very basic layout for the ui.</p>

      Git Workflows - added in new workflow for when someone makes a pull request. <p>Typescript (+ html and css) - 
      making a game... configs, unit tests, oh my!</p>
      <p>ECS - excalibur.js is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system\">an 
      Entity-Component-System</a> under the hood. Where components are raw data, entities are containers of components, 
      and systems manipulate the raw data.</p>
      <p>Webstorm - figured out how to add specific commands into the run debug configurations!</p>
      <p>CSS - Grid, why did the designs from HTML5 use a custom grid system? Found that it can be hard to keep the grid 
      rows the same size, it was simpler in the tb-a due to the grid being an exact size, both number of rows and 
      columns and size of the tag..</p>
