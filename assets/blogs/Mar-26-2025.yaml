      It’s springtime here and you can definitely tell, in my area. The skies are gray, beautiful gray or constant day 
      nonstop pouring down rain or all four seasons in one day, but more importantly Cherry blossoms are out. The there 
      are some flowers blooming in the middle of my yard very surprised to see that. Also the season of animals shedding 
      and allergies… there is cat fur everywhere in my house. No creative projects this week, was caught up reading.

      I had an interesting problem with trying to deploy on the 20<sup>th</sup>, it seems to be a semi-common problem 
      with Git Pages. Found the <a href=\"https://www.githubstatus.com/\"> GitHub status website</a> where you can 
      subscribe to updates on when things go down or come back up, thank you <i class=\"fa-brands fa-reddit\"></i> 
      <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</a>. Originally thought it had been due to starting a 
      <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/\">Google Analytics</a> set up.

      Ah, first time implementing a new unit testing library. Soo many struggles, jest is relativity simple to set up 
      simple tests, but you have to make sure you are using modules rather then just text when importing in html files, 
      note that webstorm likes to use node js assert rather than jest. Setting up the environment to run tests that 
      process html element changes was a pain, like staying up till 3am kind of pain when you will have to get up at 
      9am.

      <i class=\"fa-brands fa-google\"></i> <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/\">Google Analytics</a>, I did want 
      to know my sites metrics, I'm enough of a game designer to know metrics are a powerful tool. I ended up using 
      <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/\">Google Analytics</a> through 
      <a href=\"https://tagmanager.google.com/\">Google Tags</a> because I thought that I had set up analytics 
      incorrectly, it wasn't, just <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Git Pages</a> being down.

      The website project is in Javascript, CSS, HTML and JSON, so I've been practicing them. Jest, jsdom setting up and 
      implementing. Also got the frustration of AI being an idiot, nooo I am not editing my package-lock thank you very 
      much. Despite being brand new at, in this case, node.js I can tell that would be a bad idea.
